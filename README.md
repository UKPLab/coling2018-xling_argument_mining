> **Abstract:** Argumentation mining (AM) requires the identification of complex discourse structures and has
lately been applied with success monolingually. In this work, we show that the existing resources
are, however, not adequate for assessing cross-lingual AM, due to their heterogeneity
or lack of complexity. We therefore create suitable parallel corpora by (human and machine)
translating a popular AM dataset consisting of persuasive student essays into German, French,
Spanish, and Chinese. We then compare (i) annotation projection and (ii) bilingual word embeddings
based direct transfer strategies for cross-lingual AM, finding that the former performs
considerably better and almost eliminates the loss from cross-lingual transfer. Moreover, we
find that annotation projection works equally well when using either costly human or cheap
machine translations. Our code and data are available at http://github.com/UKPLab/coling2018-xling_argument_mining.
